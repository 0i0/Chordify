Chordify
========

Chordy app for spotify


this have two parts: 

	Spotify client App

	Heroku Server Side

you actually need only the Client for now untill they find this and take it down
i guess it violates some terms of service.. i never read them

any way if they take down the server you can run it localy and just replace the link in

client/Chordify/chordify.js line 37 to your local server

+ the server side is deploy ready to heroku so you can also deploy your on


secondly since this will probably never make it to be official spotify app center
you need to got through a little trouble to install it

Activate your account as developer here: https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/

than follow the tutorial

or simply create a "Spotify" directory in you home folder and put the content of the client folder in there

than open Spotify and in the search bar just type

spotify:app:chordify

Wallaaaa, Play a song and you imidiatly will have the chords so you can play along..

P.S.

It is very unfortunate that art is commercialized!
